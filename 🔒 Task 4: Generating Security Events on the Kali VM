🔒 Task 4: Generating Security Events on the Kali VM
To confirm that the Elastic Agent is functioning correctly and forwarding logs to your Elastic SIEM, we’ll generate some security-related events using Nmap.

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It can:

Scan hosts for open ports
Identify services running on target systems
Detect operating systems and network vulnerabilities

🛠 1. Install Nmap (if not using Kali Linux)
If you’re not using Kali Linux (where Nmap is preinstalled), install it by running:

sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install nmap

🌐 2. Identify Your Kali VM’s IP Address
To scan your Kali VM or host machine, you’ll need the correct IP address. Run:

ip a
Look for an entry like inet 192.168.x.x under the correct network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

🔍 3. Run Basic Nmap Scan
Run a basic scan on your Kali VM’s IP address:

sudo nmap
Replace with your actual IP address.

💡 Example:

sudo nmap 192.168.1.10

🌟 4. Run Additional Nmap Scans for More Events
Generate more security events by running different types of scans:

TCP SYN Scan (Stealth Scan):

sudo nmap -sS
(Common for identifying open ports stealthily.)

TCP Connect Scan:

sudo nmap -sT
(Used when SYN scan is not available.)

Full Port Scan:

sudo nmap -p-
(Scans all 65,535 ports.)

Service Version Detection:

sudo nmap -sV
(Identifies services and versions running on open ports.)

OS Detection and Traceroute:

sudo nmap -A
(Performs OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.)

Verify Security Events in Elastic SIEM
Head back to your Elastic SIEM dashboard.
Go to Kibana → SIEM → Detections and check for logs related to Nmap scans, such as:
Open port detections
Suspicious network scanning activity
Service enumeration events
