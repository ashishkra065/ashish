📊 Task 6: Create a Dashboard to Visualize Security Events
Elastic SIEM allows you to create custom dashboards to visualize logs, track patterns, and detect anomalies. In this task, we will create a simple dashboard that shows the count of security events over time.

🚀 Step-by-Step Guide
1️⃣ Access the Dashboard Section
Go to the Elastic web portal: Elastic Cloud
Click on the menu icon (☰) at the top-left.
Under the “Analytics” section, select “Dashboards”.

2️⃣ Create a New Dashboard
Click on the “Create dashboard” button (top-right corner).
Provide a meaningful name for your dashboard, e.g., SIEM Security Events Dashboard.

3️⃣ Add Visualizations
Click the “Create Visualization” button to add a new chart.

4️⃣ Choose a Visualization Type
Select either:
📈 Line Chart (for continuous trends over time)
📊 Area Chart (for cumulative visualizations)

5️⃣ Configure the Visualization
In the “Metrics” section:
For the Vertical Axis (Y-Axis), select:

Aggregation: Count
For the Horizontal Axis (X-Axis), select:

Aggregation: Date Histogram
Field: @timestamp
Interval: Auto

6️⃣ Finalize and Save
Once the chart is configured, click “Save and return” to add it to the dashboard.
Click “Save” on the dashboard page to store your work.
You can add more visualizations later, such as:
📌 Top Nmap Events by Host
🔒 Authentication Failure Trends
🌐 Geo-location of Network Events
🎯 Outcome
✅ A fully functional dashboard that visualizes security event trends over time, helping you identify suspicious patterns and analyze system behavior.
