Task 3: Setting Up the Elastic Agent to Collect Logs
In Elastic SIEM, an Elastic Agent is used to collect and forward security-related events from your Kali Linux VM to your Elastic SIEM instance. This allows for centralized analysis and real-time monitoring.

🚀 Step-by-Step Guide
🔐 1. Access Elastic SIEM Instance
Log in to your Elastic Cloud instance.
In the Kibana dashboard, click the main menu (☰) on the top-left corner.
Scroll down and select “Integrations.”
🔍 2. Search and Install Elastic Defend
In the Integrations page, use the search bar to search for:

Elastic Defend
Click on Elastic Defend to open its integration page.
Click “Install Elastic Defend” and follow the on-screen installation instructions.

💻 3. Copy the Installation Command
On the installation page:
Select "Linux" as the operating system.
Copy the provided command to your clipboard (this command installs the Elastic Agent and links it to your deployment).

🖥️ 4. Install the Elastic Agent on Kali VM
Open the terminal in Kali Linux.
Paste and run the copied command:

Example (Replace with actual command from Elastic SIEM)
sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=https://your-deployment-url --enrollment-token=your-token
The installation process might take a few minutes.
🎯 5. Verify the Agent Installation
Once you see the message:

Elastic Agent has been successfully installed.
The agent will automatically start collecting and forwarding logs.

Verify the agent's status by running:

sudo systemctl status elastic-agent.service
The output should indicate that the service is active (running).

🌐 6. Troubleshooting Installation Issues
If you encounter errors, ensure your Kali VM is connected to the internet:

ping -c 4 google.com
If there’s no internet connection, check your VirtualBox network settings (set to NAT or Bridged Adapter) and try again.
