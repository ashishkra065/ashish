🔍 Task 5: Querying for Security Events in Elastic SIEM
With data from the Kali VM successfully forwarded to Elastic SIEM, we can now query and analyze these logs to detect security events.

🚀 Step-by-Step Guide

1️⃣ Access Logs in Elastic SIEM
In your Elastic Deployment, click the menu icon (☰) in the top-left corner.
Under “Observability”, click on the “Logs” tab to view logs collected from the Kali VM.
2️⃣ Filter Logs with Search Queries
Use the search bar to filter logs based on specific security events. For example:

🔍 To find Nmap scan-related events:

event.action: "nmap_scan"

🔐 To find logs involving sudo commands:

process.args: "sudo"

3️⃣ Execute the Search

Click on the “Search” button to run the query.
⏳ Note: It might take a few minutes for events to populate, so try refreshing if logs don’t appear immediately.
4️⃣ Analyze and Investigate Events

The filtered results will be displayed in a table below.
Click on the three dots (⋮) next to each event to view detailed information, including:
Event timestamps
Host details
Process arguments
User activity

💡 Bonus: Generate More Security Events
To deepen your understanding, try creating additional security scenarios:

🔑 Authentication Failures:
Attempt SSH logins with incorrect passwords:
ssh username@host-ip
🔒 Brute-force Attempts:

Repeated incorrect password entries to simulate brute-force attacks.
